# Simple program
Simple Ezpass system MVC Java  window base + web 

Hi all, this is my java programming final project. 
It is very basic and simple program. Hope can help someone :)


For window base I used Java Swing GUI. 
  So basically, if you want to use my code
    
   1.first you need to seting your database(I'm using sql).
    
   2.second after all the database setting complete(including creating tables in database) you may change the import path of each code.
    
    
 For webbase I used HTML,JSP and Servelet
  
  1.first you need the Blazix.
  
  2.second put all of the code into your Blazix/webfiles/your forder/
      
  3.third put all the Servelet code into your Blazix/classes forder/
  
  4.and the entity object of webase is the same of window base, so you can download in windowbase/com/ezpass/
